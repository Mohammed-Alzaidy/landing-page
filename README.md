                                                         LANDING PAGE PROGECT 

                                                    //What I do in this project // 
in this project I try to put some dynamic content to a ststic page by using JS and dom structure I have learned .
* first thing I have do to the project in js code is makeing the function which add new section tow the project when some event occured .

* next step is that makeing the function which will add the new link to the nave bar which belongs to the new section added 
to enable the user to find it easly .

* then makeing the first four sections and add ther links automatecally to  the nav bar when the user load the page .

* then I made the function which will add the active class "(in it some instructions will be applied to choosen class )" to the section appeares to the screen .  

* I add button when this button clicked it will add new section to the main page and add new nav link to the nav bar 

* I added the function which make the scroll behavior of the page  smoothly . 

* I used THE MDN website to learn (getboundingclientrec() function ) to use it for adding  the active section to an  active class.

* I searched on interner how to make the scroll of the page smoothly but I think it is more easy to do that by CSS . (scrollbevavior : smooth )
